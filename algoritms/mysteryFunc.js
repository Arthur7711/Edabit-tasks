// Reverse Coding Challenge #6
// This is a reverse coding challenge. Normally you're given explicit directions with how to create a function. Here, you must generate your own function to satisfy the relationship between the inputs and outputs.
// Your task is to create a function that, when fed the inputs below, produces the sample outputs shown.
// Examples
// here it'll we like all digits *
console.log(mysteryFunc(152)); //➞ 10
console.log(mysteryFunc(832)); //➞ 48
console.log(mysteryFunc(19)); //➞ 9
console.log(mysteryFunc(133)); //➞ 9
